Usage: USalign PDB1.pdb PDB2.pdb [Options]

Options:
    -mol  Type of molecule(s) to align.
          auto: (default) align both protein and nucleic acids.
          prot: only align proteins in a structure.
          RNA : only align RNA and DNA in a structure.

     -mm  Multimeric alignment option:
          0: (default) alignment of two monomeric structures
          1: alignment of two multi-chain oligomeric structures
          2: alignment of individual chains to an oligomeric structure
             $ USalign -dir1 monomers/ list oligomer.pdb -ter 0 -mm 2
          3: alignment of circularly permuted structure
          4: alignment of multiple monomeric chains into a consensus alignment
             $ USalign -dir chains/ list -suffix .pdb -mm 4
          To use -mm 1 or -mm 2, '-ter' option must be 0 or 1.

    -ter  Number of chains to align.
          3: only align the first chain, or the first segment of the
             first chain as marked by the 'TER' string in PDB file
          2: (default) only align the first chain
          1: align all chains of the first model (recommended for aligning
             asymmetric units)
          0: align all chains from all models (recommended for aligning
             biological assemblies, i.e. biounits)

 -TMscore Whether to perform TM-score superposition without structure-based
          alignment. The same as -byresi.
          0: (default) sequence independent structure alignment
          1: superpose two structures by assuming that a pair of residues
             with the same residue index are equivalent between the two
             structures
          2: superpose two structures, assuming that a pair of residues
             with the same residue index and the same chain ID are
             equivalent between the two structures
          5: sequence dependent alignment: perform glocal sequence
             alignment followed by TM-score superposition.
             -byresi 5 is the same as -seq
	  6: superpose two complex structures by first deriving optimal
             chain mapping, followed by TM-score superposition for residues
             with the same residue ID

      -I  Use the final alignment specified by FASTA file 'align.txt'

      -i  Use alignment specified by 'align.txt' as an initial alignment

      -m  Output rotation matrix for superposition

      -d  TM-score scaled by an assigned d0, e.g., '-d 3.5' reports MaxSub
          score, where d0 is 3.5 Angstrom. -d does not change final alignment.

      -u  TM-score normalized by an assigned length. It should be >= length
          of protein to avoid TM-score >1. -u does not change final alignment.

      -o  Output superposed structure1 to sup.* for PyMOL viewing.
          $ USalign structure1.pdb structure2.pdb -o sup
          $ pymol -d @sup.pml                # C-alpha trace aligned region
          $ pymol -d @sup_all.pml            # C-alpha trace whole chain
          $ pymol -d @sup_atm.pml            # full-atom aligned region
          $ pymol -d @sup_all_atm.pml        # full-atom whole chain
          $ pymol -d @sup_all_atm_lig.pml    # full-atom with all molecules

 -rasmol  Output superposed structure1 to sup.* for RasMol viewing.
          $ USalign structure1.pdb structure2.pdb -rasmol sup
          $ rasmol -script sup               # C-alpha trace aligned region
          $ rasmol -script sup_all           # C-alpha trace whole chain
          $ rasmol -script sup_atm           # full-atom aligned region
          $ rasmol -script sup_all_atm       # full-atom whole chain
          $ rasmol -script sup_all_atm_lig   # full-atom with all molecules

      -h  Print the full help message, including additional options

Example usages ('gunzip' program is needed to read .gz compressed files):
    USalign 101m.cif.gz 1mba.pdb             # pairwise monomeric protein alignment
    USalign 1qf6.cif 5yyn.pdb.gz -mol RNA    # pairwise monomeric RNA alignment
    USalign model.pdb native.pdb -TMscore 1  # calculate TM-score between two conformations of a monomer
    USalign 4v4a.cif 4v49.cif -mm 1 -ter 1   # oligomeric alignment for asymmetic units

Additional options:
      -v  Print the version of US-align

      -a  TM-score normalized by the average length of two structures
          T or F, (default F). -a does not change the final alignment.

   -fast  Fast but slightly inaccurate alignment

    -dir  Perform all-against-all alignment among the list of PDB
          chains listed by 'chain_list' under 'chain_folder'. Note
          that the slash is necessary.

   -dir2  Use chain1 to search a list of PDB chains listed by 'chain2_list'
          under 'chain2_folder'
          $ USalign chain1 -dir2 chain2_folder/ chain2_list

 -suffix  (Only when -dir1 and/or -dir2 are set, default is empty)
          add file name suffix to files listed by chain1_list or chain2_list

   -atom  4-character atom name used to represent a residue.
          Default is " C3'" for RNA/DNA and " CA " for proteins
          (note the spaces before and after CA).

  -split  Whether to split PDB file into multiple chains
           0: treat the whole structure as one single chain
           1: treat each MODEL as a separate chain
           2: (default) treat each chain as a separate chain

           2: tabular format very compact output
          -1: full output, but without version or citation information

  -TMcut  -1: (default) do not consider TMcut
          Values in [0.5,1): Do not proceed with TM-align for this
          structure pair if TM-score is unlikely to reach TMcut.
          TMcut is normalized as set by -a option:
          -2: normalized by longer structure length
          -1: normalized by shorter structure length

           0: (default) do not align mirrored structure
           1: align mirror of Structure_1 to origin Structure_2,
              which usually requires the '-het 1' option:
              $ USalign 4glu.pdb 3p9w.pdb -mirror 1 -het 1

    -het  Whether to align residues marked as 'HETATM' in addition to 'ATOM  '
           0: (default) only align 'ATOM  ' residues
           1: align both 'ATOM  ' and 'HETATM' residues
           2: align both 'ATOM  ' and MSE residues

   -se    Do not perform superposition. Useful for extracting alignment from
          superposed structure pairs

           1: SPICKER format
           3: PDBx/mmCIF format

Advanced usage 1 (generate an image for a pair of superposed structures):
    USalign 1cpc.pdb 1mba.pdb -o sup
    pymol -c -d @sup_all_atm.pml -g sup_all_atm.png

Advanced usage 2 (a quick search of query.pdb against I-TASSER PDB library):
    wget https://zhanggroup.org/library/PDB.tar.bz2
    tar -xjvf PDB.tar.bz2
    USalign query.pdb -dir2 PDB/ PDB/list -suffix .pdb -outfmt 2 -fast
